# Hi, I'm Gregory. Welcome to my website!

## Purpose
As part of the Data Science & Statistics club here at Western Michigan University, a lot of us expressed interest in creating personal websites to showcase our abilities and projects. 

At the moment, this website is essentially an improved resume. I wanted to create this site as a foundation to build upon. As I'm still early in my degree, I don't have any projects to show off yet. Once I do, I can easily add a section to this site and bada-bing-bada-boom.

This site is customized for every viewport (I believe), and will look great on any device -- thank you bootstrap!

## Template
I do feel bad for using a template. I really do. However, my time is important too. I'd rather spend time studying and creating projects to show off rather than build a site entirely from scratch. I will leave a link to the template I used and customized for my site.
